Betz limit: optimal wind turbine effeciency == 75% of betz == 59%  -->  .75 * .59 = .44
Solar more constant cuz math
Wind less cuz ^3 mention effiecny



Slide 1 - We are analyzing th effectiveness. Of the shit.

Slide 2 - Problem: Rose requires lots of money. Reduce the cost by  reducing the shit. Moving to self sustained power.

Slide 3 - How we approached our problem. Look into specific types of alternative energy. Spcify a particular building.

Slide 4 - Talk about the first two and their ridiculousness. Then  move on to the rull options solar and wind.

Slide 5 - Explain Criteria for comparison.

Slide 6 -
